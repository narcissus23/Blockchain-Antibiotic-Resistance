# Blockchain for Combating Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria

## Project Overview
This project explores the potential of blockchain technology in addressing the global health crisis posed by multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR). The initiative aims to tackle the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance and the stagnation in new antibiotic discoveries by leveraging blockchain for improved research collaboration, drug development, and antibiotic usage monitoring.

## Key Objectives
1. **Enhance Collaboration in Antibiotic Research**:
   - Facilitate secure and transparent data sharing among researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and institutions.
   - Incentivize contributions to research through tokenization and blockchain-based rewards.

2. **Track Antibiotic Usage**:
   - Monitor prescriptions and usage to reduce overuse and misuse.
   - Ensure the authenticity of antibiotics through supply chain transparency.

3. **Encourage New Drug Development**:
   - Use blockchain for secure intellectual property management.
   - Develop token-based incentive systems for researchers and pharmaceutical companies.

4. **Raise Public Awareness**:
   - Use blockchain to store and share verified educational materials on antibiotic resistance.

## Proposed Features
- **Decentralized Research Network**: Facilitate global collaboration in real-time.
- **Prescription and Usage Monitoring**: Immutable records of antibiotic prescriptions to combat overuse.
- **Supply Chain Transparency**: Track antibiotics from production to distribution to prevent counterfeiting.
- **Funding Transparency**: Smart contracts for research grant distribution and accountability.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (or Hyperledger for private networks)
- **Programming Languages**: Solidity (for smart contracts), Python/JavaScript (for dApp development)
- **Frontend**: React.js (for user interfaces)
- **Backend**: Node.js or Flask
- **Database**: IPFS (for decentralized data storage)
